Hello, thank you for coming this repository.
We are currently working on uploading the code for replicating our experiments.
However, there exist two versions for benchmarking safe optimization algorithms (one used for GECCO 2022, and one used for our draft for a journal version), we are working on uploading them seperately.
The work is almost completed, and the version used for experiments in GECCO 2022, Boston, US, will be uploaded on around 23rd of July.
